# Etch-A-Sketch

An app of an original childhood toy, but prettier!

Users can use their arrow keys to draw on the etch-a-sketch canvas. It creates a beautiful rainbow line that loops through colors as it goes along.

There are also hard buttons at the bottom to control the movement as well.

And of course, the Shake button to shake the canvas clean again!
